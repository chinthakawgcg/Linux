1. Hard Block via Firewall

sudo ufw deny from 203.161.43.136

2. Configure Fail2Ban to catch "Flood" traffic
To prevent future IPs from doing this, you need a specific "DDOS" jail.

A. Create a new filter:
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/nginx-flood.conf

[Definition]
failregex = ^<HOST> -.*"(GET|POST|HEAD).*$
ignoreregex = 

B. Enable the Jail:
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local

[nginx-flood]
enabled = true
port    = http,https
filter  = nginx-flood
logpath = /var/log/nginx/access.log
findtime = 60
bantime  = 86400
maxretry = 300

This will ban any IP hitting your server more than 300 times in one minute for a full day.

3. Check what it's hitting
To see exactly what that IP was trying to do, run this:

grep "<Suspected IP address>" /var/log/nginx/access.log | head -n 20

4. Verify the Ban
After running the UFW command, check your Nginx logs again:

tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
